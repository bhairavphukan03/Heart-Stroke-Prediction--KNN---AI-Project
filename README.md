# Heart-Stroke-Prediction--KNN---AI-Project

To implement Heart Stroke Prediction, a system can be established using Machine Learning, a subset of Artificial Intelligence capable of processing copious amounts of data in a short period and building a comprehensive view of the data that assists in discovering patterns and providing practical insights.
Based on the data and its patterns, a model trained by Machine Learning concepts can predict the probability of occurrence of a heart stroke in a patient based on their personal and medical history. The accuracy of this prediction is a crucial factor for successful early diagnosis.
This proposed research aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the supervised learning algorithms, their accuracy and the pros and cons of using them to design an effective Heart Stroke Prediction model.
